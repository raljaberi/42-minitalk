# minitalk  

**minitalk** is a 42 project that explores interprocess communication using UNIX signals. It involves creating a client and server that communicate through `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals to transmit messages. This project enhances understanding of signal handling, bitwise operations, and process synchronization, providing a deeper insight into low-level system interactions.
